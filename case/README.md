## Variety of holding bases (more to come):
* ESP32 30 pin, 51,5 x 28,5 mm
* ESP32 38 pin, 58 x 28 mm
* ESP8266 30 pin (NodeMCU), 58 x 31,2 mm
* ESP32-CAM, 40 x 27 mm
* TTGO T1 38 pin, 53,8 x 26,9 mm
* NANO 30 pin, 43,7 x 18 mm
* Wemos D1 mini - credits to Luc3as https://github.com/Luc3as/Air-quality-Sensor - check out his design on https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2997734 - the base should be compatible (it will need some drops of hot glue to glue the base into the housing)

## Different shapes
* "Virus" shaped 
* "Cloud" shaped - credits to Luc3as https://github.com/Luc3as/Air-quality-Sensor - check out his design on https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2997734 - the bases should be compatible (maybe they need some drops of hot glue due to difference in wall-thickness)
* to come soon: Rectangular with rounded corners

## Versions
* v0.2 initial release
* v0.3 added side holes on top tentacle for better breathing of MH-Z19P sensor
* v0.4 added version for 0.96" OLED + two more bases (TTGO T1 + NANO)
* v0.5 correction base TTGO T1, added premarked holes for LEDs
