* ESP8266 30 pin (NodeMCU), 58 x 31,2 mm
* ESP32-CAM, 40 x 27 mm
* Wemos D1 mini - check out https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2997734 - the base should be compatible (it will need some drops of hot glue to glue the base into the housing)

## Different shapes
* "Virus" shaped 
* "Cloud" shaped - check out https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2997734 - the bases should be compatible (maybe they needs some drops of hot glue due to reduce the 0,5 mm increased clearance in wall-thickness)
* to come soon: Rectangular with rounded corners
